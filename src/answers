1. A constructor creates an instance of a class.

2. Through polymorphism, you can treat a child class as either the child class or the parent class.
    For example, you can call methods in Wagon and Engine directly from RollingStock, but you can also
    have methods specific to Wagon or Engine. With polymorphism, you can have less duplicate code.
